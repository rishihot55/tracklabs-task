# tracklabs-task
Frontend Task for Tracklabs

## Installation instructions
This app is Express 4 based and relies on hbs (Handlebars.js) and as such, requires the standard dependencies required. To install the modules, run `npm install` or `sudo npm install` depending on the operating system used. All the dependencies are automatically installed.

To start the server, run `npm start`. It will run on port 3000 by default.
